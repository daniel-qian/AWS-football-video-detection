# AWS-football-video-detection
---
background: 
---
In the recent machine learning projects, the demand of machine learning as a service has increased rapidly, many famous projects and developments are built based on such service, through this project, I will explore AWS SageMaker service by deploying it on a end-to-end machine learning solution.

main task:
---
Performing an end-to-end machine learning tasks based on AWS SageMaker service and various machine learning frameworks and modules, training and deploying state-of-art object detection models from scratch, to provide a object detection solution that detect football players and their number on football videos.

method:
---
Deploying Sagemaker to manage machine learning processes including data set processing, files managements, training model, eval- uating model, applying model into video detection.

conclusion reached: 
---
Despite limitations of using a fully-managed machine learning service, such as black-box, SageMaker still provides a easy-to-manage machine learning environment, by deploying Sage- Maker to common machine learning tasks, efficiency is increased, espe- cially when handling a large project involved many developers.
